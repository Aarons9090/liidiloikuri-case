# liidiloikuri
Liidiloikuri is a GPT based AI tool that helps a company enhance existing sales leads by combining and storing data about potential customers. The sales representative can then generate sales ideas and emails about selected company. This project was done as a university project for a consulting company.

### My role
I worked in the role of a Product Owner. My duty was to keep track of product development and work closely with the project manager to deliver a working product to the customer. I was also responsible for the UI/UX design and visual style of the product, a large part of the frontend development and some of the backend. The project was done from scratch and no pre-existing code was available.
